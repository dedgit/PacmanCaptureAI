# PacmanCaptureAI

This AI came in second out of 27 teams in my CMPS 140 class at UC Santa Cruz.  The specific file that contains my AI is `myTeam.py`.  To get an overview of the game, see `instructions.html`.  To read about how my AI was devised and operates, see `PacmanWrite-Up.pdf`.

To get a look at the AI in action, enter the following into your terminal:
> python capture.py -r myTeam

This will start a match against the baseline agent provided by the instructor.  I have also included a number of recorded games that were simulated against some of my classmates' bots in the `Game Recordings` folder.  These can be viewed with the following command:
> python capture.py --replay=FILENAME
